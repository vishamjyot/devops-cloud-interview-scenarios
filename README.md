# 🚀 DevOps & Cloud — Scenario-Based Interview Questions

> **770 real-world scenario questions with plain-language answers** — covering Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD, Terraform, Docker, Linux/SRE, Observability, Networking, Security, and Git.

This repo was built as a study companion for DevOps and Cloud engineers preparing for interviews at all levels. The focus is on **scenario-based questions** — the kind where an interviewer describes a real situation and asks *"what would you do?"* — because that's how mid-to-senior interviews actually work.

## 🌐 Read On The Go

### Web companion site

We also built a **companion website** so you can browse the same material in a browser—**instant search**, **dark and light themes** for long study sessions, and the same structure as the repo.

**Features**

- 🔍 Search across **750+** scenarios instantly
- 📊 Difficulty levels: **L1** (Fresher), **L2** (Mid), **L3** (Senior)
- 🗂️ **11 domains** — Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, Docker, Linux/SRE, Observability, Networking, Security, Git, and more
- 🔖 Bookmarks for last-minute review
- 🌙 Dark & light themes, no ads, no tracking

**Live site:** [techikrish.github.io/devops-cloud-interview-scenarios](https://techikrish.github.io/devops-cloud-interview-scenarios/)

### Android app (offline)

After that, we shipped an **Android app** that packages the same scenario Q&A for **fully offline** use—no network required, so it is **ready to go** whenever you have a few minutes (commute, break room, or right before the interview).

**Features**

- 🔍 Search across **750+** scenarios instantly — offline
- 📊 Difficulty levels: **L1** (Fresher), **L2** (Mid), **L3** (Senior)
- 🗂️ **11 domains** — Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, CI/CD, Docker, Linux/SRE, Observability, Networking, Security, Git, and more
- 🔖 Bookmarks for last-minute review
- 🌙 Dark mode, no ads, no tracking, **100% offline**

## 🎯 How to Use This Repo

1. **Pick your weak domain** — don't study what you already know well. Start with one domain.
2. **Cover the answer first** — try to answer the scenario yourself *before* reading the answer.
3. **Focus on the "what the interviewer is testing" note** — understanding the intent helps you structure better real answers.
4. **Practice out loud** — DevOps interviews are conversations, not written tests. Talk through your reasoning.
5. **Learn from patterns** — notice recurring troubleshooting patterns across scenarios.

---

## 🏷️ Difficulty Levels

Each question is tagged with a level:

- **`[L1]`** — Fresher / 0–1 year — foundational knowledge, simple debugging
- **`[L2]`** — Mid-level / 2–4 years — production experience, architecture decisions
- **`[L3]`** — Senior / SRE / 5+ years — complex systems, design tradeoffs, incident response

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Interviewees

- **1–2 weeks to interview?** Focus on `[L1]` and `[L2]` in your main domain.
- **Deep prep?** Do all scenarios in order of difficulty.
- **Weak domain?** Pick 2–3 scenarios daily for focused learning.

### For Interviewers

Use these scenarios to build interview guides:
- Pick scenarios across all difficulty levels.
- Mix different domains for well-rounded candidates.
- Scenarios are designed to be answered in 5–10 minutes.
